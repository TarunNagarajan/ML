PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook AI. It provides dynamic computation graphs, enabling flexible model building and debugging. The core data structure in PyTorch is the tensor, similar to NumPy arrays but optimized for GPUs. PyTorch's autograd module allows automatic differentiation, making it suitable for deep learning tasks. The framework also includes high-level APIs like torch.nn for neural networks and torch.optim for optimization. With its ease of use and strong GPU support, PyTorch is widely used for research and production in AI and machine learning.
